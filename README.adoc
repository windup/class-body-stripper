== Class Body Striper

Class Body stripper is a tool for stripping method bodies from classes in jar archive to reduce the size of the jar and keep the class bytecode to be resolvable by jave compiler.

=== Usage

On command line you can use fat jar which includes all required dependencies:

```
   java -jar class-body-stripper-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar <input.jar> <output.jar>
```

If you would like to it use with detached jar dependencies: 

```
   java -cp asm-all-5.1.jar:commons-io-2.4.jar -jar class-body-stripper-<version>.jar
```
